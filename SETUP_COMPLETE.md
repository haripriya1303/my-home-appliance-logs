# Monorepo Setup Complete ✅

## What was accomplished:

### 1. Root package.json Configuration
- ✅ Added `"dev"` script using `concurrently` to run both frontend and backend
- ✅ Added `"start"` script to start backend in production mode
- ✅ Added `concurrently` as a development dependency
- ✅ Maintained existing `"build"` script for frontend

### 2. Backend package.json Configuration  
- ✅ Updated `"start"` script to use `index.js` entry point
- ✅ Kept `"dev"` script for development with nodemon
- ✅ Maintained `"build"` script for TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Added alternative `"start:compiled"` script for direct dist/app.js execution

### 3. Backend Entry Point
- ✅ Created `backend/index.js` as deployment entry point
- ✅ Configured to require the compiled `dist/app.js` after build

### 4. Build Verification
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully to `dist/` directory
- ✅ Backend compiles TypeScript successfully to `backend/dist/`
- ✅ Both development and production modes tested and working

### 5. Deployment Configuration Files
- ✅ `build.sh` - Backend build script for Render
- ✅ `build-frontend.sh` - Frontend build script for Render  
- ✅ `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- ✅ `verify-render-setup.js` - Verification script to check deployment readiness

## Scripts Reference:

### Development:
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend concurrently
npm run dev

# Frontend runs on: http://localhost:8082
# Backend runs on: http://localhost:3001
```

### Production Build & Start:
```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build

# Build backend  
cd backend && npm run build

# Start backend in production
npm start  # or cd backend && npm start
```

## Render Deployment Options:

### Option 1: Separate Services (Recommended)
- **Frontend (Static Site):** Build command: `npm run build`, Publish directory: `dist`
- **Backend (Web Service):** Root directory: `backend`, Build: `npm run build`, Start: `npm start`

### Option 2: Single Service
- **Web Service:** Build: `./build.sh`, Start: `npm start`

## Environment Variables Needed for Backend:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url`
- `CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-url.onrender.com`

## Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

Run `node verify-render-setup.js` to verify everything is properly configured.

Both frontend and backend are now fully configured for Render deployment!
